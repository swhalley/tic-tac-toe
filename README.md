# tic-tac-toe

One of my oldest projects. This is from a coding competition at my first job. Shows where I started in my career. But may be some of the worst code I ever wrote. Many years ago when Sun owned Java, they had a variation of this on their website and I decided to try an emulate what they had done as a learning experience. Adding in AI and a UI to support. The original links to that source can't be found. 

Originally this was a Java 1.4 project; some changes have been made over the years to run it and play with friends. Current status is workable, maybe...
This project pre-dates maven/gradle when libs were packaged with applications in source. Didn't upload the libs for this project as they are out of date and suffer security issues.
